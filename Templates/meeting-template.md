Here is a simple template for organising a meeting.  When meetings are booked without an objective or structure they can drift and end up being unproductive.

## Background
[This paragraph provides context as to why the meeting has come about, which informs why a person might need to be there and also includes any pre-requisite information / documents that is needed for the meeting to be useful]
 
## Objective
[The intended outcome of the meeting to be achieved.]
 
## Agenda
[The structure of the meeting]


# Example

## Background
We have been having a lot of issues with production running slow due to increased load on the server.

## Objective
Confirm a solution for speeding up the production website

## Agenda
9.30 - Review raised incidents
